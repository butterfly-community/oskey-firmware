# How to Use

This document assumes that you have completed the development tutorial on the [homepage](https://github.com/butterfly-community/oskey-firmware) or have already flashed the latest firmware to your development board according to the [Firmware Quick Flash Guide](https://github.com/butterfly-community/oskey-firmware/tree/master/doc/board).

First, click to open the OSKey official website [https://www.oskey.xyz/settings](https://www.oskey.xyz/settings).

### Demo Video

Here is a demo video, which is the video version of the text and images below.

## Check Version

Click the Connect button in the upper left corner, which should change from gray **Connect** to green **Connected**. If it doesn't change, there may be other tabs or apps that have opened the connection, please confirm and close them.

The OSKey Status bar should display the firmware version number in green, for example **OK Version: 0.3.0**. If it shows "Not Found OSKey firmware", please confirm that the firmware has been flashed or disconnect and try selecting another interface.

### Generate Mnemonic Phrase

Click Generate to generate a 24-word mnemonic phrase by default. Please write it down on paper. Do not copy, screenshot, or take photos.

If you already have a mnemonic phrase, you can choose the import function. Enter the mnemonic phrase separated by spaces and click import. Please note that the current version only supports **English** mnemonic phrases.

<br/>

### Note

The generated mnemonic phrase will only be displayed once, please write it down carefully. Refreshing the page will make it disappear **permanently** and cannot be recovered.

<br/>

## Generate Address

By default, it generates from the first address of the Ethereum path, i.e., **m/44'/60'/0'/0/0**. You can choose other paths. Click **Get Address** to get the address.
